 * I/O exceptions are checked exceptions
 * So the main class must handle exceptions
 * Can use the try/catch or throw IOException
 * To throw exceptions, declare as:
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
 * 
 * Program must close both input and output files after they are done
 * unless they are put in the try-with-resource block
 * You can assume that input file has the correct format
